# AZ-store Project

The AZ-store project is a simple web application designed to allow users to add items to a virtual shopping cart. This project was primarily created for the purpose of learning and exploring the PHP programming language in the context of web development.

## Technologies Used

The AZ-store project leverages several common web technologies:

1. **HTML** (HyperText Markup Language): It is used for the basic structure of the web page, including creating forms for adding items to the cart.

2. **Sass**: A CSS preprocessor that simplifies style management and enhances CSS code readability.

3. **PHP** (Hypertext Preprocessor): The server-side language is used to handle business logic, such as adding and removing items from the cart, as well as managing user data.

## Features

The AZ-store project includes the following features:

1. **Displaying Items**: Users can view a list of items available for purchase.

2. **Adding to Cart**: Users can add items to their cart by specifying the desired quantity.

3. **Cart Modification**: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of items in their cart or remove items from the cart.

4. **Total Calculation**: The project calculates the total cost of the cart based on the added items and their quantities.
